_DEEP_ANALYZER_DESCRIPTION = """A tool that performs systematic, step-by-step analysis or calculation of a given task, optionally leveraging information from external resources such as attached file or uri to provide comprehensive reasoning and answers.
* At least one of `task` or `source` must be provided. When both are available, the tool will analyze and solve the task in the context of the provided source.
* The `source` can be a local file path or an uri. Support file extensions and uri are as follows:
 - Text: txt, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, csv, pdf, json, jsonl, jsonld, py, pdb, xml...
 - Image: png, jpg, jpeg...
 - Audio: mp3, m4a, wav...
 - Video: mp4, mov...
 - Archive: zip, rar... (NOTE: DO NOT need to unpack the archive, this tool will automatically handle it.)
 - Uri: https://xx.html, http://xx.htm, http://xx.pdf, file://xx, data://...

* When the task involves playing a game or performing calculations. Please consider the conditions imposed by the game or calculation rules. You may take extreme conditions into account.
* When the task involves spelling words, you must ensure that the spelling rules are followed and that the resulting word is meaningful.
* When the task involves compute the area in a specific polygon. You should separate the polygon into sub-polygons and ensure that the area of each sub-polygon is computable (e.g, rectangle, circle, triangle, etc.). Step-by-step to compute the area of each sub-polygon and sum them up to get the final area.
* When the task involves calculation and statistics, it is essential to consider all constraints. Failing to account for these constraints can easily lead to statistical errors.
